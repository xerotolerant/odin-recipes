    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>

            let rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat. Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly
            floured surface until very thin.</li>
        <li>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30
            seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more.</li>
        <li>Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
